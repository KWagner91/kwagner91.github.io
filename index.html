        <h2>Coding for our Future</h2>
          <p>"Why would I want to start to code?" I should convince you? The Internet is an essential part of our lives nowadays, just imagine the anarchy without it... </p> <p>By learning to code you are part of the gang who shapes the Internet, create tools for other people and try to make all our lives easier (or make money)</p>

        <h2>What can you do?</h2>
          <p>Once you decided "I want to code!" where do you start? Well, that's the big question, it depends what you want to do... Beginner-friendly websites like <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000">Udacity</a> start with Web design to teach you to think like a coder. Only masochists start with C ;-)</p>
          <p>Examples of Coding Languages: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Python</li>
              <li>Javascript</li>
              <li>PHP</li>
              <li>R</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Mental Benefits</h2>
          <p><em>To code or not to code</em>, that is your question? Learning to code helps you understand how Website, Apps and Software is build. </p>
          <p>Coding is all about problem solving and being creative, which can be quite challenging and frustrating. However, by overcoming your coding problems, you feel like a <b>Coding Master of Disaster</b> ;-)</p>
          <p>If you code long enough, you will start dreaming in 0 and 1 as well... Just kidding, it hasn't happened to me yet! You only start to understand nerdy jokes like: <em>"There are only 10 types of people"</em></p>
        <h2>Other Benefits</h2>
          <p>Coding can be done from home, from a library or wherever you find a computer. You don't even need a powerful machine! </p>
          <p>If you code from home, you have the comfort of your apartment and pyjamas :-P</p>
